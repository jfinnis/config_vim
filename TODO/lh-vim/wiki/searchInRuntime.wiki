#summary searchInRuntime: Plugin for searching within list of directories
#labels Featured

== 1. Features ==

=== 1.1. Find and execute on files ===
This plugin define several commands that:
 # search for files whose name match specified _{file-patterns}_ within list of directories (_{var}_, `$PATH` or '`runtimepath`').
 # execute the Ex command _{cmd}_ on the files found, if any.

In other words, if you are an adept of:
{{{
$> find {path} -name {pattern} -exec {command}
}}}
then, you may be interested by these three VIM commands:
{{{
:SearchInVar[!] {var} {cmd} {file-patterns} .. [ "|[0]" {params} .. ]
:SearchInPATH[!]      {cmd} {file-patterns} .. [ "|[0]" {params} .. ]
:SearchInRuntime[!]   {cmd} {file-patterns} .. [ "|[0]" {params} .. ]
}}}

*Note:* All these commands, as well as the new `:Runtime` command provides contextual auto-completion on the command line.


=== 1.2. Advanced files opening ===

==== 1.2.1. Split-Open files from '`path`' ====
{{{
:Split[!] {file-patterns} ...~
:Vsplit[!] {file-patterns} ...~
}}}
look for files into 'path' and split open them like |`:sp`| or |`:vsp`| do.

When [!] is included, all found files are opened.
When it is not included only the first file found is opened.

They are somehow equivalent to: `:SearchInVar &path :sp {file-patterns}`

*Note:* File-completion is provided, unlike |`:sp`| and |`:vsp`|.

==== 1.2.2. Goto-or-Split-Open files from '`path`' ====
{{{
GSplit[!] {file-patterns} ...~
GVSplit[!] {file-patterns} ...~
}}}
look for files into 'path'.

If several files match the _{file-patterns}_, the user will be asked to choose
one file to open.

If a matching file is already opened in a window, this window is made the
active window. If several files match, we jump to the first matching window. 
Using {bang} (!) will override this behaviour. Instead, the user will be asked
which file must be opened if more than one match the {file-patterns}.

In either cases, if the selected (implicitly or explicitly) file is not already
opened in a window, then a new window is split opened (like |`:sp`| or |`:vsp`| do)
with the selected file.

*Notes*
 * These commands are related to |`:Sp`| and |`:Vsp`|.
 * File-completion is provided.
 * When several files match, common path denominator are stripped from the choices proposed (e.g. "/some/path/bar/file" and "/some/path/foo/file" are presented as "bar/file" and "foo/file")

==== 1.2.3. Goto ... which file ? ====

`gf`, `CTRL-W_f`, and `CTRL-W_v` have been overridden in order:
 * to ask the user which file must be opened if several files match, 
 * and to jump to an already opened window containing the selected file.

|`CTRL-W_v`| will do work as |`CTRL-W_f`|, but the window will be split vertically.
