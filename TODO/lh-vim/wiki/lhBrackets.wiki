#summary map-tools: LH' bracketing system
#labels Featured,lh-Brackets

== Features ==

map-tools provides various commands and functions to help design smart and advanced mappings dedicated to text insertion.

It is made of three sub-systems:
  * [lhBrackets#The_placeholder_subsystem a placeholder subsystem],
  * [lhBrackets#The_bracketing_subsystem the core bracketing-system],
  * [lhBrackets#The_VimL_library various VimL functions to support ftplugin definitions].

=== The placeholder subsystem ===

This subsystem provides functions and mappings to:
  * mark places in the code where we could jump to later,
   See the help about `!mark!`, `Marker_Text()`, and `<Plug>MarkersMark`
  * jump forward and backward to those places.
    See the help about `!jump!`, and `<Plug>MarkersJumpF`

The marker/placeholder characters:
  * default to the French quote characters («»),
  * can be specified on a filetype basis,
  * are converted to match the current encoding,
  * can be shared with the ones from imaps.vim (`:h g:use_place_holders`).

Jumping to the next/previous placeholder:
  * is binded to `<M-ins>` or `<C-J>` by default (see `:h <Plug>MarkersJumpF`),
  * can be tuned to delete or select the placeholder the cursor is jumping to (`:h g:marker_prefers_select`, `:h g:marker_select_empty_marks`),
  * can select or ignore the placeholder where the cursor is currently within (if any) (`:h g:marker_select_current`, `:h g:marker_select_current_fwd`)
  * may move the line of the placeholder (we jump to) to the middle of the window (`:h g:marker_center`)
  * respects `'wrapscan'`,
  * opens the folder where the placeholder, we jump to, is.


=== The bracketing subsystem ===

==== Brackets insertion ====

This subsystem provides a command that helps define INSERT-, NORMAL-, and VISUAL-mode mappings to insert any pairs of brackets-like characters.

  * The INSERT-mode mappings will 
    * insert the pair of brackets-like characters when the opening one is triggered, add a placeholder after the closing character, and move the cursor between the two characters;
    * insert the closing character when pressed, or move after it if it is the next character after the cursor ;
  * The VISUAL-mode mapping will surround the current selection with the pair of bracket-like characters ;
  * The NORMAL-mode mapping will select the current word (or the current line depending on the use of the newline (`-nl`) option), and then surround this selection with the pair of bracket-like characters.

It is possible to:
  * tune what is exactly inserted in INSERT-mode (thanks to the `-open` and `-close` options),
  * not insert the placeholder (depending on `b:usemark` value),
  * specify which keys sequence actually triggers the mappings defined (thanks to the `-trigger` option),
  * define the mappings only in some modes (thanks to the options `-insert`, `-visual`, and also `-normal`)
  * make the mappings line-wise (thanks to the `-nl` option),
  * tune how the NORMAL-mode mapping select a current _anything_ (thanks to the `-normal` option),
  * toggle the definitions of all the brackets mappings by pressing `<F9>` (`:h <Plug>ToggleBrackets`).
  * Make the mappings global with `:Brackets!`, or local to a buffer with `:Brackets`

Here is an excerpt from the C&C++ brackets definitions, see the documentation for more help.
{{{
let b:usemarks         = 1
let b:cb_jump_on_close = 1
 
:Brackets { } -visual=0 -nl
:Brackets { } -visual=0 -trigger=#{ 
:Brackets { } -visual=1 -insert=0 -nl -trigger=<localleader>{
:Brackets { } -visual=1 -insert=0

:Brackets ( )
:Brackets [ ] -visual=0
:Brackets [ ] -insert=0 -trigger=<localleader>[
:Brackets " " -visual=0 -insert=1 -escapable
:Brackets " " -visual=1 -insert=0 -trigger=""
:Brackets ' ' -visual=0 -insert=1
:Brackets ' ' -visual=1 -insert=0 -trigger=''
:Brackets < > -open=function('lh#cpp#brackets#lt') -visual=0
}}}

*Note:* This feature has been completely rewritten for the version 1.0.0 of map-tools. The old way of tuning the brackets insertion is no longer available.

==== Brackets replacement ====

map-tools provides mappings (originally from auctex.vim) to replace a pair of bracket-characters by another pair of bracket-characters. See `:h brackets_manipulations` for more information.
  
=== The VimL library ===

As [lhVimLib lh-vim-lib], map-tools provides a few functions of its own. All these functions are specialized into the definition of smart abbreviations and INSERT-mode mappings.

|| `MapNoContext()`, `MapNoContext2()` || Core functions to define mappings that only expand outside of _string_, _comment_, and _character_ contexts ||
|| `Map4TheseContext()` || Like `MapNoContext()`, except this time we can specify which text must be returned depending on the current context ||
|| `InsertAroundVisual()` || This is the core surrounding function ; the surrounding text is not interpreted ||
|| `Surround()` || Interprets the `!.*!` mappings that are passed to `InsertAroundVisual()` (`!cursorhere!` tells were to put the cursor). This function also recognises when the selected area is actually a marker/placeholder in order to not surround, but expand instead. ||
|| `BuildMapSeq()` || Core function that interprets `!.*!` mappings ||
|| `EatChar()`, `:I(nore)abbr` || Permits to define abbreviations that do not insert a whitespace when the `<space>` key is used to trigger the abbreviation ||
|| `InsertSeq()` || High level function that interprets `!.*!` mappings, and take the context into account ||
